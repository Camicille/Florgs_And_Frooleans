PROJECT TITLE: Florgs and Frooleans
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Improve our game making skills
VERSION or DATE: 2, Sep 20 2018
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Click Run!
AUTHORS: Camille Otillio
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Use right and left arrow keys to eat tasty florgs, increasing your speed, and avoid frooleans, which have a hefty point penalty if eaten by one


Don't die too many times or the game will end

Extra Credit: Florgs are randomly generated into the game as time goes on.

All actors start off in (new) random locations each time scenarios are started/reset
